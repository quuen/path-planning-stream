## Assumptions

#1 VICON data is received at 100Hz but the control loop runs at much smaller frequency. 
The state feedback is therefore not that accurate, however the robot and obstacle are not
moving fast/moving throughout so I think this should be ok.

#2 For a moving obstacle, a constant velocity is considered in the state feedback part and used for the stream function calculations, assuming that the velocity remains constant at all times.


## Observations

#1 Actuator delay is ~1s. No matter what frequency (10Hz-100Hz) is set for
the calculation/control loop, there is no response for the initial ~1s.

#2 The number of loop iterations were set in such a way that for frequency 
in range (10Hz-100Hz), the total execution time of this calculation/control
loop would be atleast ~10s of which the first 1s would have no response 
from the actuators. Post 1s duration, the actuators begin to respond to the
control values and therefore a smooth movement is observed.

#3 dT or time step has no significance on the actual time elapsed unless it
is synchronized to the loop execution rate. 
e.g. 
tf = 10;
dt = 0.01;
r = rosrate(100);
for t = 0:dt:tf

number of iterations = 10/0.01 = 1000
time of each iteration = 1/100 = 0.01s
total execution time = 0.01*1000 = 10s
